<p>Full Stack Development refers to the process of developing both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) components of a web application. A full-stack developer is skilled in handling all layers of an application, including databases, servers, systems engineering, and client-side interfaces.</p>
 <h2> Front End</h2>
 <p>Front-end development focuses on the client side of web applications, where users interact with the website or application. It involves designing and implementing the visual<br> 
 <p> elements,layout, and interactive features that enhance the user experience (UX).</p>
